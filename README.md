# Kotlitaliano

A simple set of inline functions to make possible to write Kotlin code in Italian.
This doesn't change the language of the compiler, but it makes the code more readable for Italian developers.
That can be useful for teaching programming to people who don't speak English, or for writing code that is more readable for the team.

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE THIS IN PRODUCTION CODE.
